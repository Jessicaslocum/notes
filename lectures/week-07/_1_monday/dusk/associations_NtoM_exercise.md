# In Class Exercise 2
## Many-to-Many Associations

Let's pair into groups of two. 

Let's create models for something like Amazon.com. Amazon has many products, and many customers. Customers can purchase many products at one time by creating a shopping cart, and that cart becomes an order once the customer completes checkout.

Your mission, should you wish to accept it:
  1. Create 3 models (the third model can be called "sale" or "order")
  2. Use the rails console to add products and customers to 2-3 'sales' (or 'orders')
  3. Use the rails console to display all products and customers associated with each order.
