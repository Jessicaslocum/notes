# Classical Inheritance Examples

In this directory, you'll find a number of different examples of Classical Inheritance. Here's an overview of what's here:

In `without_file_separation`:

  * In this directory, you'll find a few simple examples of classical inheritance in ruby.
  * However, the parent and child classes (where child inherits from parent) are included in the same file.

In `with_file_separation`:

  * This directory includes a few examples of classical inheritance that are quite similar to `without_file_separation`, but
      - Each class is separated into its own file and child classes include their dependencies using `require_relative`.

## Exercises ##

Review these examples and try to understand them. Once you're finished, do the following:

  1. Make a list of all the classes involved, for each class, write down:
    - The properties
    - The methods

  2. Once you have your list, try to recreate the classes by yourself, **including** their inherited characteristics.
