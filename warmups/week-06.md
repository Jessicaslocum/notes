# Week 6 Warmups

This week is about re-implementing data structures and sorting/search algorithms we already know in Ruby:

- Binary search
- Merge sort
- Linked list (TDD style with RSpec)
- Stack and queue (TDD style with RSpec)

You will pair up in groups of your respective rows. Each morning, one group will present.
