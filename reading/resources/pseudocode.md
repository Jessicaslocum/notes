# Pseudocoding

Many of you asked for help finding resources about pseudocoding, so I've gone ahead and started looking. As I find resources I think are reliable, I'll post the links here. 

Eventually, if I start posting articles about pseudocode that fall into different styles or categories, I may begin creating some additional structure for this file. But for now, this will just be a list of links and maybe some short explanations/recommendations.

Thanks!

## Pseudocoding Links:

### Reading:
  - [Wikipedia: Pseudocode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)
  - [Pseudo-code: Becoming a Better Programmer -- Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/good-practices/p/pseudo-code#)
  - [Pseudocode: Let's Learn ICT](http://www.letslearnict.com/pseudo-code.html)
      + If you check this one out, I'd recommend just using it for the monopoly example and for the 'exercises' they suggest you try writing pseudocode for.

### Videos:
  - [Youtube: Programming Basics #36 Writing Pseudocode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G0EYfrrDT8)
      + Quite basic, but actually a decent overview... and besides, I enjoy/get nostalgic when I hear the old-school, text-to-speech narration.
