# You'll all need wireframes

I want to make sure to mention again that you're all going to need to create wireframes for your projects. This isn't just for our benefit, but for yours as well. Building without wireframing can often lead to your heading down a rabbit hole without realizing in advance. Hopefully, your lectures from our wonderful UXDI instructor have included some good tips on how to do this, but if you're confused about wireframes, please check out these links:

# What can I use to create my wireframes?

If you're not sure what software to use to create your wireframes **and you're not comfortable using a pencil and paper**, the following tools are good and many of them are free or almost free:

[Balsamiq Mockups](http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups)
I've used this one and it's definitely a good tool.

[Omnigraffle - Pretty much the original wireframing tool for mac](http://www.omnigroup.com/)
This is what I use, and they do offer a free trial period, but after that you'll need a license to use it and it's not cheap.

[Gliffy - web based platform for wireframes](http://www.gliffy.com/)
Never used this one, but I've heard good things. Also, if you like using chrome, there's a [chrome app for this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gliffy-diagrams/bhmicilclplefnflapjmnngmkkkkpfad?hl=en-US&utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher).

[Mockflow](http://www.mockflow.com/)
This one lets you create working prototypes (not to be confused with JS prototypes) meaning you can link your wireframes together to get a sense of the user experience.

[HotGloo](http://www.hotgloo.com/)
Also web based. I tried it a while back and its pretty simple to use.

[Proto.io](http://proto.io/)
I love this tool, and its pretty good for wireframing, but its actually intended for prototyping. If you want to build a mockup of your project that includes clickable buttons and such, this is a good choice.

[LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com)
This one's been around forever, is web based, free and very easy to use. It also includes Google Docs integration (so you can save your work to Google Drive or collaborate with others) and there's a [Google Chrome Desktop app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lucidchart-diagrams-deskt/djejicklhojeokkfmdelnempiecmdomj?hl=en-US&utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher) if you're interested in that.
